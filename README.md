# Hotel APP

This Hotel Flutter app is being developed with a focus on clean code principles and utilizing the MVVM architectural pattern. The app leverages a carefully selected set of packages, including dio for network communication, flutter_bloc for state management, go_router for routing, get_it for dependency injection, cached_network_image for image caching, provider for dependency management, dartz for error handling, equatable for value comparisons, and flutter_staggered_animations for visually appealing animations.
